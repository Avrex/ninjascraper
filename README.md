### Ninja Scraper

Gets your exams from Ninja Course!
v1.1

## Features
* Currently worked for EVERY course that has potential exams. 
* Worked extremely well for CS courses thanks to Vaishall Shankar. 
* Modified to work for every course by me, but you need to know at least your professor's last name and the department's abbreviation to search for the exams.

## Install
You must have Python 2 on your computer (2.7 preferred). After that, just save the scrape_ninja.py file on your local machine, or fork/clone/pull it if you have a Github account.

## Usage: For CS Courses only
Please scroll down and read the heading below if you are not here for CS's Exams. I mean Computer Science, not Cognitive Science or Chicano Studies...

On the terminal, type  
```
python scrape_ninja.py 61C 
```
(You may want to add a '2.7' after python if you have multiple versions of Python installed)

## Usage: For All other Subjects
